# AI-Based Actuator/Sensor Fault Detection With Low Computational Cost for Industrial Applications

## Description

This is the repo for our IEEE TCST 2015 paper: [AI-Based Actuator/Sensor Fault Detection With Low Computational Cost for Industrial Applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7111282?arnumber=7111282). 

We present a low computational cost method for detecting actuator/sensor faults. For more details, refer to our [IEEE TCST 2015](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7111282?arnumber=7111282) paper.
